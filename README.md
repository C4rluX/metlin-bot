# ü§ñ Metlin - Discord Bot
The full open source of my upcoming Discord Bot, **Metlin**.

This repository includes a wide variety of interesting functions and features exclusively made for the bot from scratch. You can check out most of them in the **utils** folder.

## üíª Running

- Install Node.js if you don't have it. The bot was developed and tested in the version 18+.
- Install all the required dependencies with `npm install`.
- Create a file called `.env` in the proyect root folder. Copy the contents of `.env.example` and fill in everything that is needed.
- Create a file called `config.json` in the proyect root folder. Copy the contents of `config.example.json` and fill in everything that is needed.
- Build the proyect using `npm run build`. Then run `npm run start:build` to start the bot. You can also just run `npm start` to run the proyect using **ts-node**.
